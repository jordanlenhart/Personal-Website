# Personal Website  

## About  
This repository contains the source code for my personal website (live at [jordanlenhart.vercel.app](https://jordanlenhart.vercel.app)).  
The site showcases my background at Orange County Department of Education, my web development journey and skills I have learned along the way, and some projects Iâ€™ve built - like SceneIt, a web application that lets users browse, share, and review TV shows.

## Built With  
- **React and Supabase**
